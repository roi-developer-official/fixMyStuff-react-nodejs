# fixMyStuff-react-nodejs

#react and nodejs project.
the idea behind this project is that a user can request a fixiation for hes broken equipment and also decide how much he's willing to pay for it.
another user can look at those offers and decide to bid he's offer for getting the job done, also he can set a new price for fixing this product.
the extra special thing about this project is that on every professional there can be seen comments and past jobs that he have done and also a rating
so that the user can decide if he went to hire him for the job or not.
